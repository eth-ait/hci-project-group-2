# Programmable Networks, Group 2
#### Miro Haller, Roger Baumgartner, Tim Matter, Jules Bachmann and Jan Urech

## Project description
### Problems the user faces
- Non-intuitive interaction with topology, low-level router configuration needed
- Manual changes have hard to predict outcomes
- Error-prone maintenance and update process
- No way to directly specify high-level requirements

### Goals of our project
Given a high-level network property and a network topology, figure out how to visualize to the user how the property affects the network configuration.

### Notes from first meeting
[Preparation Notes](resources/first_meeting/preparation.docx)  
[Debrief Notes](resources/first_meeting/debrief.docx)

## Ideas
    TODO
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users / the company
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.
Upload the PPT presentation that you discussed with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

Optional: in this part you can document the needfinding, ideation, and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. ) (Weeks 3-6)

### Personas

[David Fischer, Junior Network Engineer](resources/personas/David%20Fischer.md)  
[Hans-Peter Dullinger, Senior Network Engineer](resources/personas/Hans-Peter%20Dullinger.md)

## Evaluation
    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion. 
Upload the document shared with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.

Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas (Weeks 6-10)

## Final solution
    TODO
Describe your final solution to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.
Upload your video to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

(Weeks 10-14)
