# Programmable Networks, Group 2
#### Miro Haller, Roger Baumgartner, Tim Matter, Jules Bachmann and Jan Urech

## Project description
### Problems the user faces
- Non-intuitive interaction with topology, low-level router configuration needed
- Manual changes have hard to predict outcomes
- Error-prone maintenance and update process
- No way to directly specify high-level requirements

### Goals of our project
Given a high-level network property and a network topology, figure out how to visualize to the user how the property affects the network configuration.

## Ideas

### Personas

[David Fischer, Junior Network Engineer](resources/personas/David%20Fischer.md)  
[Hans-Peter Dullinger, Senior Network Engineer](resources/personas/Hans-Peter%20Dullinger.md)

### High-level properties of the network
We were asked by our stakeholder to derive the properties which we should later visualize. [Here](resources/ideation/requirements.md) is a list of what we found in various papers and projects.
