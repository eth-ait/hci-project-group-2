# Programmable Networks, Group 2
#### Miro Haller, Roger Baumgartner, Tim Matter, Jules Bachmann and Jan Urech

## Project description
### Problems the user faces
- Non-intuitive interaction with topology, low-level router configuration needed
- Manual changes have hard to predict outcomes
- Error-prone maintenance and update process
- No way to directly specify high-level requirements

### Goals of our project
Given a high-level network property and a network topology, figure out how to visualize to the user how the property affects the network configuration.

## Ideas

### Personas

[David Fischer, Junior Network Engineer](resources/personas/David%20Fischer.md)  
[Hans-Peter Dullinger, Senior Network Engineer](resources/personas/Hans-Peter%20Dullinger.md)

### High-level properties of the network
We were asked by our stakeholder to derive the properties which we should later visualize. [Here](resources/ideation/requirements.md) is a list of what we found in various papers and projects.

### Deliverables
[Programmable networks: 3 ideas PPT presentation](Deliverables/Idea_Presentation.pptx) [(pdf)](Deliverables/Idea_Presentation.pdf)

    TODO
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users / the company
Optional: in this part you can document the needfinding, ideation, and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. ) (Weeks 3-6)

## Evaluation
    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion. 
Upload the document shared with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.

Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas (Weeks 6-10)

## Final solution
    TODO
Describe your final solution to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.
Upload your video to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

(Weeks 10-14)
