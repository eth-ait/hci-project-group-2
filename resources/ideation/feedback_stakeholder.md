# Feedback Stakeholder

## General

- Think about how to integrate the older guy.
    - Some high-level overview, a checkbox or status window that shows you that everything is correct
    - More geeky user can go more in depth
- Discuss those ideas with network operators and Laurent

## Visualization requirements

- Unambiguous ~ Intuitive is contradicting a bit. There is a tradeoff
- Resource management?
    - Maybe drop that requirement, it is too high level
    - Included in other requirements

## Requirements

- Preferential routing
    - Color scale, which are used first.
- Affects of failures, connected to
    - Failure consistency 
    - Preferential routing
- Security is often called way-pointing

In general many requirements are related.

## Split screen

- First focus on requirements, visualise them in graph, then look at per node view
    - How do we priorize the requirements of a node, there are many
- Too many items in photoshop-list
- More for the young guy
- Next step would be:
    - How to visualize requirements
    - When a node is selected, mark the edges that can fail without affecting the/all requirements of that node
- Scissors-tool to cut edges and see what happens if that edge fail

## Social media

- Not so useful

## VR

- Not so useful for the old guy
- Likes the idea from a gaming perspective
- Easier to show contextuals
