# ETH NetOps

- Display subnets instead of routers
    - E.g. traffic from firewall makes no sense
    - Networks on VRF not on machines
    - Routing logically separated, normally you have an extra level
- From: Select interface, then which address when clicking on node
- Automation? They configure 6525 lines by hand, complex
- Important for them: 
    - VLAN, IPs and subnets, forwarding
- Effect of filter functions unclear, asked question why is security now faded out (reason was that he filtered)
- Security: Different understandig
    - How could you achieve that traffic doesn't go through a node?
    - Can only decide for next hop
    - Also for whole configuration, he doesn't know any system that does this
    - Security for them: Ports, which ports are open, tcp/udp
- Load balancing: Not working on lower levels
    - Doesn't exist on lower levels, either you have only one connection or you do equal-cost for all routes
    - Don't do it in live networks
    - Load balancers actually work on layer 7, not on lower levels
- You have to route dynamically, static routing doesn't work together with redundancy
- Bulldozer tool gets nobody
- Is the effect of deleting an edge visualized? Other effects? Directly in graph?
- Task 3
    - Use it not often: Click on it
    - Use it often: Filter
- Filter
    - From-To filter is really necessary, reachability *many* requirements
    - Need both: Filter for subnet, then click around in graph
- Layers
    - Add layers in graph? (OS stack layers) For zooming
    - Do you want to structure it? 
    - When you open it first, it is very messy
- For them a diagram that has nothing to do with the live network makes no sense
    - Important to connect it to current network
    - Add monitoring information
    - Colour links/routers with problems, so that they know where to look at --> Too much information, mails are lost
    - Or measure routing table usage
    - Network graph: Colour how strong it is used
    - Configs should be pushed automatically on the devices --> Our tool should do that, otherwise errors when applying configs
